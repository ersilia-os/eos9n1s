Title: Hemozoin inhibitor prediction using simple physicochemical parameters
Description: This very simple model using simple physicochemical parameters to predict
  hemozoin inhibition. The model is based on a HTS assay on 9, 600 compounds, from
  which 224 were hits and another 199 were randomly sampled as negatives. A traditional
  multivariate model was used to find a simple classifier of hemozoin inhibition.
  Originally, the model used ChemSpyder descriptors. Here, we replaced them with calculated (RDKit)
  versions of them. The Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was not implemented due to the need
  for refractive index estimation, which is not straightforward from SMILES.
