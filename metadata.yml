Title: Hemozoin inhibitor prediction using simple physicochemical parameters
Description: This very simple model using simple physicochemical parameters to predict
  hemozoin inhibition. The model is based on a HTS assay on 9, 600 compounds, from
  which 224 were hits and another 199 were randomly sampled as negatives. A traditional
  multivariate model as well as a Bayesian modeling average (BMA) were used to find
  parsimonious classifiers of hemozoin inhibition.
