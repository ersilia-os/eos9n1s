Title: Hemozoin inhibitor prediction using simple physicochemical parameters
Description: This very simple model using simple physicochemical parameters to 
  predict hemozoin inhibition. The model is based on a HTS assay on 9, 600 
  compounds, from which 224 were hits and another 199 were randomly sampled as 
  negatives. A traditional multivariate model was used to find a simple 
  classifier of hemozoin inhibition. Originally, the model used ChemSpyder 
  descriptors. Here, we replaced them with calculated (RDKit) versions of them. 
  The Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was not implemented due to the need for 
  refractive index estimation, which is not straightforward from SMILES.
